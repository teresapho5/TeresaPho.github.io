<div class="whytitle">Significance of Issue</div>
<div class="why">As of 2017, only 18.7% of the workforce are comprised of disabled people. Diversity encompasses over a<br> variety of different groups, and often most than not, the disabled people group does not receive enough<br> recognition or support. This sensitive issue is often overlooked or not properly addressed due to the prenotions<br> of both parties (abled vs disabled). With diversity and inclusion being a pressing issue of today, my team and<br> I decided to address and tackle on this problem ourselves.</div>
